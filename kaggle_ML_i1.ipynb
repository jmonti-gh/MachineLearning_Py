    "### A simple model (decision tree), training, and predicting.\n",
    "- Identified Patterns: he's identified price patterns from houses he has seen in the past, and he uses those patterns to make predictions for new houses he is considering.\n",
    "- Decision tree model: easy to understand, and the basic building block for some of the best models in data science. There are fancier models that give more accurate predictions.\n",
    "- Simplest possible decision tree: it divides houses into only two categories (Does house has more than 2 bedrooms? Yes or No). The predicted price for any house under consideration is the historical average price of houses in the same category.\n",
    "- We use data to decide how to break the houses into two groups, and then again to determine the predicted price in each group.\n",
    "- This step of capturing patterns from data is called fitting or training the model.\n",
    "- The data used to fit the model is called the training data (complete data set, nothing to predict). Only fit or train at this time.\n",
    "- The details of how the model is fit (e.g. how to split up the data) is complex enough that we will save it for later.\n",
    "- Prediction: after the model has been fit, you can apply it to new data to predict prices of additional homes (by example in this case)."
