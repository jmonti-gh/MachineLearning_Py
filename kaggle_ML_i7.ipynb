    "- Find and fix this problem that ruins your model in subtle ways.\n",
    "- Data leakage (or leakage) happens when your training data contains information about the target, but similar data will not be available when the model is used for prediction.\n",
    "- Two main types of leakage: __target leakage__ and __train-test__ contamination. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Target leakage\n",
    "- occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. It is important to think about target leakage in terms of the timing or chronological order that data becomes available, not merely whether a feature helps make good predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train-Test Contamination\n",
    "- For example, imagine you run preprocessing (like fitting an imputer for missing values) before calling train_test_split(). The end result? Your model may get good validation scores, giving you great confidence in it, but perform poorly when you deploy it to make decisions."

    "Data leakage can be multi-million dollar mistake in many data science applications. Careful separation of training and validation data can prevent train-test contamination, and pipelines can help implement this separation. Likewise, a combination of caution, common sense, and data exploration can help identify target leakage."
